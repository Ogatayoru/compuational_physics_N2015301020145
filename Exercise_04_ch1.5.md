## Abstract
Employ the Euler method to compute the solution to exercise 1.5 of Chapter one. And then compare the results with the exact solution to exercise 1.5. It turns out that for this case Euler method is capable of giving the exact result.
## Background
- A decay problem with two types of nuclei A and B, but now suppose that nuclei of type A decay into ones of type B, while nuclei of type B decay into ones of type A. A better analogy would be a resonance in which a system can tunnel or move back and forth between two states A and B which have equal energies.
- Now we assume that the two types of decay are characterized by the same time contant, Ï„, with ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_A$) and ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_B$) representing the numbers of nuclei, as functions of time.And they satisfy the following corresponding rate equations:
